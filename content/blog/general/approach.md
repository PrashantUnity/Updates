## Define Input - Output

* How Input is Stored.
* What kind of value are there.
* Are there any negative value.
* Will there be any Empty data.
* Can i assume there is always valid input.
* Will the size/number of data be greater that integer max value.
* Are we returning indexes/data.
* What if there is multiple Answer.

---

## Check on Size  - Range - Scale of data

* How big is the size of input.
* Do we take into account of integer overflow.
* Size of array  or N or  Length
* What should we do if the size of data count grater than Interger range.  
  * Suggest we can use linked list
  * own custom data type.

## Checking for running Enviroment

* What type of enviroment the algorithm will be running.
* Can I modify Original Data
* Can use Leatest Language Feature.

---

## Walk Through Solution

* Start Writing comment in Editor.

  * Outline Step by Step
  * What it is what you will be doing
* Let them give feedback before you even start Programming

---

## During Coding

* Always speack What you are thinking
* See if you can Divide problem into Subproblem
* Seperate code into Logical unit
* Discuss Tradeoff

  * Consider Pros and Cons.
* Are we Favouring Time Coplexity Over Space Complexity
* Discuss about memory footprint because of recursion call
* Came with own test case and test on it.
* Explain time Complexity and Space Complexity.
